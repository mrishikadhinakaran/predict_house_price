House Price Prediction Project
Welcome to the predict_house_price project! This repository provides a machine learning solution for predicting housing prices using a curated dataset and modern data science techniques.

Overview
This project aims to develop a robust model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. Accurate price estimation is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market.

Features
Data Collection and Processing:

Utilizes a comprehensive dataset with features like house age, number of rooms, population, and median income.

Data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed for optimal analysis.

Data Visualization:

Visualizes data using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends and patterns.

Includes histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

Train-Test Split:

Splits data into training and testing sets to ensure reliable model evaluation.

Model Training:

Employs advanced regression techniques, including XGBoost, for high predictive accuracy.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluates model performance using metrics such as R-squared error and mean absolute error.

Visualizes predicted vs. actual prices for easy interpretation.

Technologies Used
Python

NumPy & Pandas (Data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (Machine learning)

XGBoost (Gradient boosting)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (Optional, for interactive development)

Example
Below is a simplified example of how to use the project:

python
import pandas as pd
from src.preprocess import preprocess_data
from src.model import train_model

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('data/housing.csv')
X, y = preprocess_data(data)

# Train model
model = train_model(X, y)
